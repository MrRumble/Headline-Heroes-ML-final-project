## performance issues

- find_movie_id is slow becuase the 'id' field we are searching for is not indexed. the db must perform a full table scan to find the record.
- A full table scan involves examining each row in the table one by one until the desired record is found.
- This process is time-consuming, especially as the size of the table grows.
- It works for now but could be an interesting refactor challenge?
