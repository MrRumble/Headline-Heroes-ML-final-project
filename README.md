## CHOSEN MODEL
 (STILL TO ADD)
## FINAL TOUCHES
- So we now have a smart movie recommendation model which generates a set of similar movies based on user viewing patterns.

- We can now pull this all together on the user front. In our approach we identify and sort their top 5 rated movies, provided they are rated above 4 stars.

- Each of these top-rated movies is processed through the recommendation algorithm individually.

- This results in a new list of recommended films.

- We then flatten this list and remove any duplicates.

- Finally, we present these recommendations to the user, prioritized by overall Movie Heroes popularity.

# üçø WHAT WENT WELL üé¨

## PLANNING
We spent a lot of time planning everything, more than we did in previous projects. We understood the importance of planning well, knowing that not doing so can lead to problems down the line.

From the beginning, we made sure everyone had clear diagrams of each page's design. This made it easy to divide tasks on the Trello board, and merging our work was usually smooth with few conflicts.

Initially, we had a plan for another project on the first day. When we realized the MVP might not work out, we didn't panic. Instead, we started fresh on day two, showing our ability to adapt and keep moving forward.

## TEAM DYNAMICS
We stuck with our initial pairs throughout the project, even though it wasn't planned that way. It turned out to be really productive for us, and we kept rolling out features regularly.

Whenever we got stuck or needed a second opinion, we always leaned on each other for advice.

We had a routine of morning stand-ups at 09:30, afternoon check-ins at 14:00, and a final retro meeting before wrapping up at 17:30. This kept us all on the same page throughout.

Everyone pitched in equally, and we made sure everyone felt comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. This teamwork was key to our project's success.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Using MongoDB cloud for a shared database proved very beneficial for us.

It was especially useful because we had a large dataset, and having everything centralized in one place streamlined our workflow.

While there were a few drawbacks that we'll discuss later, overall, MongoDB cloud helped us achieve our goals effectively.

We successfully reached our MVP and even implemented some of our "nice to have" features, like the search bar, TMDB trending page, and user avatars.

We are all particularly proud of the aesthetic and style of our project, which has an eye-catching cinema vibe that we all love.

# üçø CHALLENGES üé¨

## TECH STACK
We went with Python because it's widely used in the industry for data analysis and has plenty of tools and support available, especially for machine learning.

Switching from PostgreSQL to MongoDB Cloud was a bit of a challenge as we adjusted to a new way of managing our database.

Selva, Anna, and Adrian had just wrapped up their modules on JavaScript and React, while Manith and James had recently completed their Java module. This meant Manith and James had to swiftly switch gears and get up to speed/ learn JavaScript and React, while we all had to refresh our knowledge of Python syntax.

These challenges pushed us to learn fast and adapt to new technologies throughout the project, a crucial skill for any aspiring software developer!

## MACHINE LEARNING

We had initially set out to learn, implement, and deploy our own ML algorithm, which in hindsight was quite ambitious, especially considering none of us had prior experience in machine learning; we simply shared a fascination for the subject üòÖ. Adding to the challenge, we had only 10 days to complete our project. To make it feasible, we heavily relied on abstraction and chose a model that we believed would produce the best results.

## PERFORMACE ISSUES

Our recommendation methods encountered significant slowness, sometimes taking up to 10+ seconds to execute.

This was primarily due to inefficient coding practices and unnecessary repetition of iterations, along with excessive database queries in certain methods.

Given the tight project timeline, we opted to address these issues as a "nice to have."

Nevertheless, overcoming this hurdle provided valuable insights into the critical aspects of efficient code, refactoring, and debugging to pinpoint and resolve performance bottlenecks effectively.
