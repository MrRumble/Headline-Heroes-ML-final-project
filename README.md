## CHOSEN MODEL

## FINAL TOUCHES
- So we now have a smart movie recommendation model which generates a set of similar movies based on user viewing patterns.

- We can now pull this all together on the user front. In our approach we identify and sort their top 5 rated movies, provided they are rated above 4 stars.

- Each of these top-rated movies is processed through the recommendation algorithm individually.

- This results in a new list of recommended films.

- We then flatten this list and remove any duplicates.

- Finally, we present these recommendations to the user, prioritized by overall Movie Heroes popularity.
