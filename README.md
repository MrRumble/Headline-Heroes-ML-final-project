## CHOSEN MODEL
 (STILL TO ADD)
## FINAL TOUCHES
- So we now have a smart movie recommendation model which generates a set of similar movies based on user viewing patterns.

- We can now pull this all together on the user front. In our approach we identify and sort their top 5 rated movies, provided they are rated above 4 stars.

- Each of these top-rated movies is processed through the recommendation algorithm individually.

- This results in a new list of recommended films.

- We then flatten this list and remove any duplicates.

- Finally, we present these recommendations to the user, prioritized by overall Movie Heroes popularity.

## PLANNING
We spent a lot of time planning everything, more than we did in previous projects. We understood the importance of planning well, knowing that not doing so can lead to problems down the line.

From the beginning, we made sure everyone had clear diagrams of each page's design. This made it easy to divide tasks on the Trello board, and merging our work was usually smooth with few conflicts.

Initially, we had a plan for another project on the first day. When we realized the MVP might not work out, we didn't panic. Instead, we started fresh on day two, showing our ability to adapt and keep moving forward.

## TEAM DYNAMICS
We stuck with our initial pairs throughout the project, even though it wasn't planned that way. It turned out to be really productive for us, and we kept rolling out features regularly.

Whenever we got stuck or needed a second opinion, we always leaned on each other for advice.

We had a routine of morning stand-ups at 09:30, afternoon check-ins at 14:00, and a final retro meeting before wrapping up at 17:30. This kept us all on the same page throughout.

Everyone pitched in equally, and we made sure everyone felt comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. This teamwork was key to our project's success.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Using MongoDB cloud for a shared database proved very beneficial for us.

It was especially useful because we had a large dataset, and having everything centralized in one place streamlined our workflow.

While there were a few drawbacks that we'll discuss later, overall, MongoDB cloud helped us achieve our goals effectively.

We successfully reached our MVP and even implemented some of our "nice to have" features, like the search bar, TMDB trending page, and user avatars.

We are all particularly proud of the aesthetic and style of our project, which has an eye-catching cinema vibe that we all love.
